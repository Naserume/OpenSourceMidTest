That's life (that's life) that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April
Shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June

I said, that's life (that's life)  and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stompin' on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
Cause this fine old world it keeps spinnin' around
